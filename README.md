# ~ dotfiles ~ üêà üçª

My dotfiles Repo!


## To Apply

```
chezmoi init --apply --exclude=encrypted https://github.com/Haze-sh/dotfiles.git
```

## Themes

```
flavours update all
flavours apply $SCHEME
```

- Add user preset to gradience (Until there is a command to do so)

## Backups

- permessions.backup
- fcrontab.backup

## Passwords

It is easier to use some scripts by saving passwords to gnupass rather than manually doing stuff:

- Hypothesis username as "user"
- Hypothesis token as "hypothesis"
- KeePass password as "keepass"
- KeePass TOTP password as "totp"

## Minor Caveats

- Some scripts are path dependant
	* setwallpaper
	* syncbuku
	* merge-browser-history
	* merge-mpv-data
